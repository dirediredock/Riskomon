The default dataset, MAMMO, predicts cancer risk from mammography information[^MAMMO]. The FICO dataset predicts whether a borrower will default on a loan or credit obligation[^FICO]. The SHROOM dataset predicts the risk of poisoning from mushroom toxicity[^SHROOM]. The BANK dataset predicts whether a person opens an account after a marketing call[^BANK]. The ADULT dataset predicts whether a U.S. resident earns more than $50,000 annually[^ADULT].

In Riskomon, positive feature coefficients map semantically to high risk, visually encoded with red bubbles. The MAMMO, FICO, and SHROOM datasets align with this semantic mapping. However, the BANK and ADULT datasets have a different valence: positive coefficients map to a higher likelihood of opening an account in BANK, and to higher salaries in ADULT. The alternative monochrome colormap can help navigate dataset scenarios with such different valences.
